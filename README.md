## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB database (locally or cloud-based)
- An internet connection to access external resources and dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eliscops-coding-study.git
2. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash 
   cd server
   npm install
3. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
4. Set up your environment variables by creating a .env file in the server directory. Include your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret:
   ```bash
   MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongodb_uri
   HASH_PASSWORD_SALT=your_hash_password_salt
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   # From the server directory
   node index
